### Animations
See my custom functions in [/craziest-2021.js](./assets/scripts/craziest-2021.js). Uses vanilla **DOM selectors**, **SVG manipulation**, and the lightweight [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) library for easier **CSS transitions**. Also uses [currency.js](https://currency.js.org/) for price animations, allows easier number conversion and decimal logic.
